Learning GIT

This is JD's first attempt at creating something using GIT!

We shall see how it goes...

OK we modified this by adding a new line of text.

Let see if I can duplicate what I just learned.

Ok Now let's see if the changes I make locally are 'pushed' up to the files on github!

One more time!
